   To get started with this tool you need to know some basic commands to control this CLI tool.

   > **NOTE** 
   > Use `show commands` to see all available useful commands in cli
   

1) **Check Mongo Status:**

    To get current working status of MongoDB you can use -

    ```console
    show status
    ```
2) **Go Back And Next:**

    Going back and moving forward essentially involves navigating between recent steps you've taken. For instance, if you initially *entered a database* and then 
    proceeded to *enter a collection*, using the back from the *collection stage* will return you to the *database stage* and using next from the *database stage* 
    will return you to *collection stage* .

    For going back you can use
    ```console
    back
    ```

    for going forward you can use
    ```console
    next
    ```
    
4) **Going Back To Start:**

   ```console
   home
   ```

5) **Managing MongoDB Service:**

   > **IMPORTANT**
   >  Managing MongoDB service requires **admin permission** and only supported in **Windows** operating system

   To start MongoDB service you can use -
   
    ```console
    start mongo
    ```

   In order to stop MongoDB service you can use -
   
    ```console   
    stop mongo
    ```

   For restarting MongoDB service you can use -
   
    ```console
    restart mongo
    ```
   
6) **Getting information about MongoDB on system**
   
   ```console
   get info
   ```
8) **Getting recent logs**

   ```console
   logs <log count>
   ```
   Don't forget to replace `<log count>` with count of *recent logs* you want to see

9) **RESTARTING CLI**
   ```console
    restart
   ```
