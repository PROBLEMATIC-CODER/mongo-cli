# MONGO CLI


> A CLI tool for making MongoDB management easier
<br />

I mainly use MongoDB for various projects, both personal and commercial. Sometimes, I need to manually modify data in the database, which can be time-consuming. Activities like data cleanup, schema changes, and troubleshooting often require manual intervention.

While the Mongo Shell is powerful, it can be complex, especially for basic tasks. This CLI doesn't replace the Mongo Shell but provides a simpler way to handle common operations.

I've created a user-friendly CLI (Command Line Interface) designed for MongoDB management. It's an efficient companion to the Mongo Shell, making tasks intuitive.


It's designed to handle tasks such as data cleanup, schema adjustments, troubleshooting, and more, without the complexity that the Mongo Shell sometimes presents


## üìù Features to Improve Your Work

The CLI lets you easily manage your MongoDB databases. You can do things like making changes to multiple documents at once, filtering data to get what you need, adding special labels to documents, handling the MongoDB service, and doing tasks like reading, deleting, inserting, and updating data. 

You can even give your documents new names based on specific criteria and perform operations on only the documents you want.


As a fellow developer, I understand the value of simplicity in our workflow. This CLI is here to make your life easier and more efficient. 

Give it a try and embrace a smoother MongoDB management experience. Your fellow developer-self will thank you.

##  üõ†Ô∏è BASIC COMMANDS

   Feel free to change content or customize commands according to your requirements.

   To get started with this tool you need to know some basic commands to control this CLI tool.

   > **NOTE** 
   > Use `show commands` to see all available useful commands in cli
   

1) **Check Mongo Status:**

    To get current working status of MongoDB you can use -

    ```console
    show status
    ```
2) **Go Back And Next:**

    Going back and moving forward essentially involves navigating between recent steps you've taken. For instance, if you initially *entered a database* and then 
    proceeded to *enter a collection*, using the back from the *collection stage* will return you to the *database stage* and using next from the *database stage* 
    will return you to *collection stage* .

    For going back you can use
    ```console
    back
    ```

    for going forward you can use
    ```console
    next
    ```
    
4) **Going Back To Start:**

   ```console
   home
   ```

5) **Managing MongoDB Service:**

   > **IMPORTANT**
   >  Managing MongoDB service requires **admin permission** and only supported in **Windows** operating system

   To start MongoDB service you can use -
   
    ```console
    start mongo
    ```

   In order to stop MongoDB service you can use -
   
    ```console   
    stop mongo
    ```

   For restarting MongoDB service you can use -
   
    ```console
    restart mongo
    ```
   
6) **Getting information about MongoDB on system**
   
   ```console
   get info
   ```
8) **Getting recent logs**

   ```console
   logs <log count>
   ```
   Don't forget to replace `<log count>` with count of *recent logs* you want to see

9) **RESTARTING CLI**
   ```console
    restart
   ```
